# Basketball Scores Website

This website shows live NBA scores with their box scores. Requires React framework.

# To-do

- Collect data once per refresh and call functions with scoreboard data as a parameter
- Fix times and dates on games
- Sortable tables
- Filterable tables
- Maybe add custom colors to team's box score
- Add login
- Find a better way to get past CORS rather than use nba.com as a proxy (partially fixed)
