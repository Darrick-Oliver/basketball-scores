# Basketball Scores Website

This website shows live basketball scores with their box scores using the NBA API. Requires React framework.

# To-do

- Fix team +/-
- Logo next to team's name
  - Maybe add custom colors to team's box score
- Pretty up the CSS
- Add an automatic refresh every few minutes (Box score and game score)
- Sortable tables
- Filterable tables
- Add login
- Find a better way to get past CORS rather than use nba.com as a proxy
